INTRODUCTION
------------

The Group Members Extra module add extra functionality for group memberships.

Group Contacts
This module allows you to mark group members as group contacts. These will be
shown on the Group page allowing site users to contact those members.

Group members overviews
The default Group member overview is aimed towards management of the group
members. This module provides a block and a page with the Group member.
There is a separate group permission which can be used to allow users with
any group (or site) role to view the members of a given Group Type.

Group operations blocks
There are two additional group operations blocks, one geared towards group
content operations and another towards group membership operations. In some
cases it makes a lot of sense to split this. For example if you want to
place the "Leave/Join group" links in a more prominent place.
